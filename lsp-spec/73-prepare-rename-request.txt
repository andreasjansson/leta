Prepare Rename Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.12.0

The prepare rename request is sent from the client to the server to setup and
test the validity of a rename operation at a given location.

Request:

* method: textDocument/prepareRename 
* params: PrepareRenameParams defined as follows:

export interface PrepareRenameParams extends TextDocumentPositionParams, WorkDoneProgressParams {
}

Response:

* result: Range | { range: Range, placeholder: string } | {
 defaultBehavior: boolean } | null describing a Range of the string to
 rename and optionally a placeholder text of the string content to be renamed.
 If { defaultBehavior: boolean } is returned (since 3.16) the rename
 position is valid and the client should use its default behavior to compute the
 rename range. If null is returned then it is deemed that a
 ‘textDocument/rename’ request is not valid at the given position.
* error: code and message set in case the element can’t be renamed. Clients
 should show the information in their user interface.
