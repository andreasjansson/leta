Text Document Synchronization

Client support for textDocument/didOpen, textDocument/didChange and
textDocument/didClose notifications is mandatory in the protocol and clients
can not opt out supporting them. This includes both full and incremental
synchronization in the textDocument/didChange notification. In addition a
server must either implement all three of them or none. Their capabilities are
therefore controlled via a combined client and server capability. Opting out of
text document synchronization makes only sense if the documents shown by the
client are read only. Otherwise the server might receive request for documents,
for which the content is managed in the client (e.g. they might have changed).

Client Capability:

* property path (optional):
 textDocument.synchronization.dynamicRegistration 
* property type: boolean 

Controls whether text document synchronization supports dynamic registration.

Server Capability:

* property path (optional): textDocumentSync 
* property type: TextDocumentSyncKind | TextDocumentSyncOptions. The
 below definition of the TextDocumentSyncOptions only covers the properties
 specific to the open, change and close notifications. A complete definition
 covering all properties can be found here:

/**
 * Defines how the host (editor) should sync document changes to the language
 * server.
 */
export namespace TextDocumentSyncKind {
	/**
	 * Documents should not be synced at all.
	 */
	export const None = 0;

	/**
	 * Documents are synced by always sending the full content
	 * of the document.
	 */
	export const Full = 1;

	/**
	 * Documents are synced by sending the full content on open.
	 * After that only incremental updates to the document are
	 * sent.
	 */
	export const Incremental = 2;
}

export type TextDocumentSyncKind = 0 | 1 | 2;
export interface TextDocumentSyncOptions {
	/**
	 * Open and close notifications are sent to the server. If omitted open
	 * close notifications should not be sent.
	 */
	openClose?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Change notifications are sent to the server. See
	 * TextDocumentSyncKind.None, TextDocumentSyncKind.Full and
	 * TextDocumentSyncKind.Incremental. If omitted it defaults to
	 * TextDocumentSyncKind.None.
	 */
	change?: TextDocumentSyncKind;
