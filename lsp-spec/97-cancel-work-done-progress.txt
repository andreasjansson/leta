The window/workDoneProgress/cancel notification is sent from the client to
the server to cancel a progress initiated on the server side using the
window/workDoneProgress/create. The progress need not be marked as
cancellable to be cancelled and a client may cancel a progress for any number
of reasons: in case of error, reloading a workspace etc.

* params: WorkDoneProgressCancelParams defined as follows:

export interface WorkDoneProgressCancelParams {
	/**
	 * The token to be used to report progress.
	 */
