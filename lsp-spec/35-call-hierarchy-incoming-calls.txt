Call Hierarchy Incoming Calls (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.16.0

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve incoming calls for a
given call hierarchy item. The request doesn’t define its own client and server
capabilities. It is only issued if a server registers for the
textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy request.

Request:

* method: callHierarchy/incomingCalls 
* params: CallHierarchyIncomingCallsParams defined as follows:

export interface CallHierarchyIncomingCallsParams extends
	WorkDoneProgressParams, PartialResultParams {
	item: CallHierarchyItem;
}

Response:

* result: CallHierarchyIncomingCall[] | null defined as follows:

export interface CallHierarchyIncomingCall {

	/**
	 * The item that makes the call.
	 */
	from: CallHierarchyItem;

	/**
	 * The ranges at which the calls appear. This is relative to the caller
	 * denoted by [`this.from`](#CallHierarchyIncomingCall.from).
	 */
	fromRanges: Range[];
}

* partial result: CallHierarchyIncomingCall[] 
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the
 ‘callHierarchy/incomingCalls’ request
