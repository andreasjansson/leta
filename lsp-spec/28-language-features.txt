Language Features

Language Features provide the actual smarts in the language server protocol.
They are usually executed on a [text document, position] tuple. The main
language feature categories are:

* code comprehension features like Hover or Goto Definition.
* coding features like diagnostics, code complete or code actions.

The language features should be computed on the synchronized state of the
document.
