WillSaveTextDocument Notification (
:arrow_right:
)

The document will save notification is sent from the client to the server before
the document is actually saved. If a server has registered for open / close events
clients should ensure that the document is open before a willSave notification
is sent since clients can’t change the content of a file without ownership
transferal.
