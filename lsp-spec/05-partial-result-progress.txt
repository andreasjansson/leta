Partial Result Progress

 Since version 3.15.0

Partial results are also reported using the generic $/progress notification. The
value payload of a partial result progress notification is in most cases the same
as the final result. For example the workspace/symbol request has
SymbolInformation[] | WorkspaceSymbol[] as the result type. Partial result is
therefore also of type SymbolInformation[] | WorkspaceSymbol[]. Whether a
client accepts partial result notifications for a request is signaled by adding a
partialResultToken to the request parameter. For example, a
textDocument/reference request that supports both work done and partial
result progress might look like this:

{
	"textDocument": {
		"uri": "file:///folder/file.ts"
	},
	"position": {
		"line": 9,
		"character": 5
	},
	"context": {
		"includeDeclaration": true
	},
	// The token used to report work done progress.
	"workDoneToken": "1d546990-40a3-4b77-b134-46622995f6ae",
	// The token used to report partial result progress.
	"partialResultToken": "5f6f349e-4f81-4a3b-afff-ee04bff96804"
}

The partialResultToken is then used to report partial results for the find
references request.

If a server reports partial result via a corresponding $/progress, the whole
result must be reported using n $/progress notifications. Each of the n
$/progress notification appends items to the result. The final response has to
be empty in terms of result values. This avoids confusion about how the final
result should be interpreted, e.g. as another partial result or as a replacing
result.

If the response errors the provided partial results should be treated as follows:

* the code equals to RequestCancelled: the client is free to use the provided
 results but should make clear that the request got canceled and may be
 incomplete.
* in all other cases the provided partial results shouldn’t be used.

PartialResultParams

A parameter literal used to pass a partial result token.

export interface PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * An optional token that a server can use to report partial results (e.g.
	 * streaming) to the client.
	 */
	partialResultToken?: ProgressToken;
}
