WillRenameFiles Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

The will rename files request is sent from the client to the server before files are
actually renamed as long as the rename is triggered from within the client either
by a user action or by applying a workspace edit. The request can return a
WorkspaceEdit which will be applied to workspace before the files are renamed.
Please note that clients might drop results if computing the edit took too long or
if a server constantly fails on this request. This is done to keep renames fast and
reliable.
