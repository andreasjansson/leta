Workspace Diagnostics(
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

The workspace diagnostic request is sent from the client to the server to ask the
server to compute workspace wide diagnostics which previously were pushed
from the server to the client. In contrast to the document diagnostic request the
workspace request can be long running and is not bound to a specific workspace
or document state. If the client supports streaming for the workspace diagnostic
pull it is legal to provide a document diagnostic report multiple times for the
same document URI. The last one reported will win over previous reports.

If a client receives a diagnostic report for a document in a workspace diagnostic
request for which the client also issues individual document diagnostic pull
requests the client needs to decide which diagnostics win and should be
presented. In general:

* diagnostics for a higher document version should win over those from a lower
 document version (e.g. note that document versions are steadily increasing)
* diagnostics from a document pull should win over diagnostics from a
 workspace pull.

Request:

* method: workspace/diagnostic.
* params: WorkspaceDiagnosticParams defined as follows:

/**
 * Parameters of the workspace diagnostic request.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface WorkspaceDiagnosticParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams,
	PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * The additional identifier provided during registration.
	 */
	identifier?: string;

	/**
	 * The currently known diagnostic reports with their
	 * previous result ids.
	 */
	previousResultIds: PreviousResultId[];
}
/**
 * A previous result id in a workspace pull request.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface PreviousResultId {
	/**
	 * The URI for which the client knows a
	 * result id.
	 */
	uri: DocumentUri;

	/**
	 * The value of the previous result id.
	 */
	value: string;
}

Response:

* result: WorkspaceDiagnosticReport defined as follows:

/**
 * A workspace diagnostic report.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface WorkspaceDiagnosticReport {
	items: WorkspaceDocumentDiagnosticReport[];
}

	/**
	 * The version number for which the diagnostics are reported.
	 * If the document is not marked as open `null` can be provided.

 followed by n WorkspaceDiagnosticReportPartialResult literals defined

 */
export interface WorkspaceDiagnosticReportPartialResult {
	items: WorkspaceDocumentDiagnosticReport[];
}

* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the
 diagnostic request. A server is also allowed to return and error with code
 ServerCancelled indicating that the server can’t compute the result right
 now. A server can return a DiagnosticServerCancellationData data to
 indicate whether the client should re-trigger the request. If no data is provided
 it defaults to { retriggerRequest: true }:
