Inline Value Refresh Request (
:arrow_right_hook:
)

 Since version 3.17.0

The workspace/inlineValue/refresh request is sent from the server to the
client. Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh the inline values currently
shown in editors. As a result the client should ask the server to recompute the
inline values for these editors. This is useful if a server detects a configuration
change which requires a re-calculation of all inline values. Note that the client
still has the freedom to delay the re-calculation of the inline values if for example
an editor is currently not visible.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): workspace.inlineValue 
* property type: InlineValueWorkspaceClientCapabilities defined as
 follows:

/**
 * Client workspace capabilities specific to inline values.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface InlineValueWorkspaceClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether the client implementation supports a refresh request sent from
	 * the server to the client.
	 *
	 * Note that this event is global and will force the client to refresh all
	 * inline values currently shown. It should be used with absolute care and
	 * is useful for situation where a server for example detect a project wide
	 * change that requires such a calculation.
