Base Protocol

The base protocol consists of a header and a content part (comparable to
HTTP). The header and content part are separated by a ‘\r\n’.

Header Part

The header part consists of header fields. Each header field is comprised of a
name and a value, separated by ‘: ‘ (a colon and a space). The structure of
header fields conforms to the HTTP semantic. Each header field is terminated by
‘\r\n’. Considering the last header field and the overall header itself are each
terminated with ‘\r\n’, and that at least one header is mandatory, this means
that two ‘\r\n’ sequences always immediately precede the content part of a
message.

Currently the following header fields are supported:

  Header Field Name  Value Type  Description    
  Content-Length  number  The length of the content part in bytes.    
      This header is required.    
  Content-Type  string  The mime type of the content part.    
      Defaults to application/vscode-jsonrpc;    
      charset=utf-8    

The header part is encoded using the ‘ascii’ encoding. This includes the ‘\r\n’
separating the header and content part.

Content Part

Contains the actual content of the message. The content part of a message uses
JSON-RPC to describe requests, responses and notifications. The content part is
encoded using the charset provided in the Content-Type field. It defaults to
utf-8, which is the only encoding supported right now. If a server or client
receives a header with a different encoding than utf-8 it should respond with an
error.

(Prior versions of the protocol used the string constant utf8 which is not a
correct encoding constant according to specification.) For backwards
compatibility it is highly recommended that a client and a server treat the string
utf8 as utf-8.

Example:

Content-Length: ...\r\n
\r\n
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"id": 1,
	"method": "textDocument/completion",
	"params": {
		...
	}
}

Base Protocol JSON structures

The following TypeScript definitions describe the base JSON-RPC protocol:

Base Types

The protocol uses the following definitions for integers, unsigned integers,
decimal numbers, objects and arrays:

/**
 * Defines an integer number in the range of -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
 */
export type integer = number;
/**
 * Defines an unsigned integer number in the range of 0 to 2^31 - 1.
 */
export type uinteger = number;
/**
 * Defines a decimal number. Since decimal numbers are very
 * rare in the language server specification we denote the
 * exact range with every decimal using the mathematics
 * interval notation (e.g. [0, 1] denotes all decimals d with
 * 0 <= d <= 1.
 */
export type decimal = number;
/**
 * The LSP any type
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPAny = LSPObject | LSPArray | string | integer | uinteger |
	decimal | boolean | null;
/**
 * LSP object definition.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPObject = { [key: string]: LSPAny };
/**
 * LSP arrays.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export type LSPArray = LSPAny[];

Abstract Message

A general message as defined by JSON-RPC. The language server protocol
always uses “2.0” as the jsonrpc version.

interface Message {
	jsonrpc: string;
}

Request Message

A request message to describe a request between the client and the server.
Every processed request must send a response back to the sender of the
request.

interface RequestMessage extends Message {

	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: integer | string;

	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The method's params.
	 */
	params?: array | object;
}

Response Message

A Response Message sent as a result of a request. If a request doesn’t provide a
result value the receiver of a request still needs to return a response message to
conform to the JSON-RPC specification. The result property of the
ResponseMessage should be set to null in this case to signal a successful
request.

interface ResponseMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The request id.
	 */
	id: integer | string | null;

	/**
	 * The result of a request. This member is REQUIRED on success.
	 * This member MUST NOT exist if there was an error invoking the method.
	 */
	result?: LSPAny;

	/**
	 * The error object in case a request fails.
	 */
	error?: ResponseError;
}
interface ResponseError {
	/**
	 * A number indicating the error type that occurred.
	 */
	code: integer;

	/**
	 * A string providing a short description of the error.
	 */
	message: string;

	/**
	 * A primitive or structured value that contains additional
	 * information about the error. Can be omitted.
	 */
	data?: LSPAny;
}
export namespace ErrorCodes {
	// Defined by JSON-RPC
	export const ParseError: integer = -32700;
	export const InvalidRequest: integer = -32600;
	export const MethodNotFound: integer = -32601;
	export const InvalidParams: integer = -32602;
	export const InternalError: integer = -32603;

	/**
	 * This is the start range of JSON-RPC reserved error codes.
	 * It doesn't denote a real error code. No LSP error codes should
	 * be defined between the start and end range. For backwards
	 * compatibility the `ServerNotInitialized` and the `UnknownErrorCode`
	 * are left in the range.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart: integer = -32099;
	/** @deprecated use jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart */
	export const serverErrorStart: integer = jsonrpcReservedErrorRangeStart;

	/**
	 * Error code indicating that a server received a notification or
	 * request before the server received the `initialize` request.

	export const ServerNotInitialized: integer = -32002;
	export const UnknownErrorCode: integer = -32001;

	/**
	 * This is the end range of JSON-RPC reserved error codes.

	 * message should contain human readable information about why
	 * the request failed.

	 * @since 3.17.0

	export const RequestFailed: integer = -32803;

	export const ServerCancelled: integer = -32802;

	/**

	 * modified outside normal conditions. A server should
	 * NOT send this error code if it detects a content change
	 * in its unprocessed messages. The result even computed
	 * on an older state might still be useful for the client.
	 *
	 * If a client decides that a result is not of any use anymore
	 * the client should cancel the request.
	 */
	export const ContentModified: integer = -32801;

	/**
	 * The client has canceled a request and a server has detected
	 * the cancel.
	 */
	export const RequestCancelled: integer = -32800;

	/**

	 * It doesn't denote a real error code.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	export const lspReservedErrorRangeEnd: integer = -32800;
}

Notification Message

A notification message. A processed notification message must not send a
response back. They work like events.

interface NotificationMessage extends Message {
	/**
	 * The method to be invoked.
	 */
	method: string;

	/**
	 * The notification's params.
	 */
	params?: array | object;
}

$ Notifications and Requests

Notifications and requests whose methods start with ‘$/’ are messages which are
protocol implementation dependent and might not be implementable in all
clients or servers. For example if the server implementation uses a single
threaded synchronous programming language then there is little a server can do
to react to a $/cancelRequest notification. If a server or client receives
notifications starting with ‘$/’ it is free to ignore the notification. If a server or
client receives a request starting with ‘$/’ it must error the request with error
code MethodNotFound (e.g. -32601).

Cancellation Support (
:arrow_right:
:arrow_left:
)

The base protocol offers support for request cancellation. To cancel a request, a
notification message with the following properties is sent:

Notification:

* method: ‘$/cancelRequest’
* params: CancelParams defined as follows:

interface CancelParams {
	/**
	 * The request id to cancel.
	 */
	id: integer | string;
}

A request that got canceled still needs to return from the server and send a
response back. It can not be left open / hanging. This is in line with the
JSON-RPC protocol that requires that every request sends a response back. In
addition it allows for returning partial results on cancel. If the request returns an
error response on cancellation it is advised to set the error code to
ErrorCodes.RequestCancelled.

Progress Support (
:arrow_right:
:arrow_left:
)

 Since version 3.15.0

The base protocol offers also support to report progress in a generic fashion.
This mechanism can be used to report any kind of progress including work done
progress (usually used to report progress in the user interface using a progress
bar) and partial result progress to support streaming of results.

A progress notification has the following properties:

Notification:

* method: ‘$/progress’
* params: ProgressParams defined as follows:

type ProgressToken = integer | string;
interface ProgressParams<T> {
	/**
	 * The progress token provided by the client or server.
	 */
	token: ProgressToken;

	/**
	 * The progress data.
	 */
	value: T;
}

Progress is reported against a token. The token is different than the request ID
which allows to report progress out of band and also for notification.
