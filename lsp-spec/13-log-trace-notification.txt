LogTrace Notification (
:arrow_left:
)

A notification to log the trace of the server’s execution. The amount and content
of these notifications depends on the current trace configuration. If trace is
'off', the server should not send any logTrace notification. If trace is
'messages', the server should not add the 'verbose' field in the
LogTraceParams.

$/logTrace should be used for systematic trace reporting. For single debugging
messages, the server should send window/logMessage notifications.

Notification:

* method: ‘$/logTrace’
* params: LogTraceParams defined as follows:

interface LogTraceParams {
	/**
	 * The message to be logged.
	 */
	message: string;
	/**
	 * Additional information that can be computed if the `trace` configuration
	 * is set to `'verbose'`
	 */
	verbose?: string;
}
