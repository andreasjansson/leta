Execute a command (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

The workspace/executeCommand request is sent from the client to the server to
trigger command execution on the server. In most cases the server creates a
WorkspaceEdit structure and applies the changes to the workspace using the
request workspace/applyEdit which is sent from the server to the client.

Client Capability:

* property path (optional): workspace.executeCommand 
* property type: ExecuteCommandClientCapabilities defined as follows:

export interface ExecuteCommandClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Execute command supports dynamic registration.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;
}

Server Capability:

* property path (optional): executeCommandProvider 
* property type: ExecuteCommandOptions defined as follows:

export interface ExecuteCommandOptions extends WorkDoneProgressOptions {
	/**
	 * The commands to be executed on the server
	 */
	commands: string[];
}

Registration Options: ExecuteCommandRegistrationOptions defined as
follows:

/**
 * Execute command registration options.
 */
export interface ExecuteCommandRegistrationOptions
	extends ExecuteCommandOptions {
}

Request:

* method: ‘workspace/executeCommand’
* params: ExecuteCommandParams defined as follows:

export interface ExecuteCommandParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams {

	/**
	 * The identifier of the actual command handler.
	 */
	command: string;
	/**
	 * Arguments that the command should be invoked with.
	 */
	arguments?: LSPAny[];
}

The arguments are typically specified when a command is returned from the
server to the client. Example requests that return a command are
textDocument/codeAction or textDocument/codeLens.

Response:

* result: LSPAny 
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the request.
