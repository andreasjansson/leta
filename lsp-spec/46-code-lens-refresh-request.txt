Code Lens Refresh Request (
:arrow_right_hook:
)

 Since version 3.16.0

The workspace/codeLens/refresh request is sent from the server to the
client. Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh the code lenses currently
shown in editors. As a result the client should ask the server to recompute the
code lenses for these editors. This is useful if a server detects a configuration
change which requires a re-calculation of all code lenses. Note that the client
still has the freedom to delay the re-calculation of the code lenses if for example
an editor is currently not visible.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): workspace.codeLens 
* property type: CodeLensWorkspaceClientCapabilities defined as follows:

export interface CodeLensWorkspaceClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether the client implementation supports a refresh request sent from the
	 * server to the client.
	 *
	 * Note that this event is global and will force the client to refresh all
	 * code lenses currently shown. It should be used with absolute care and is
	 * useful for situation where a server for example detect a project wide
	 * change that requires such a calculation.
	 */
	refreshSupport?: boolean;
