Inlay Hint Resolve Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.17.0

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve additional information
for a given inlay hint. This is usually used to compute the tooltip, location or
command properties of an inlay hint’s label part to avoid its unnecessary
computation during the textDocument/inlayHint request.

Consider the client announcing the label.location property as a property that
can be resolved lazily using the client capability

textDocument.inlayHint.resolveSupport = { properties: ['label.location'] };

then an inlay hint with a label part without a location needs to be resolved using
the inlayHint/resolve request before it can be used.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): textDocument.inlayHint.resolveSupport 
* property type: { properties: string[]; } 

Request:

* method: inlayHint/resolve 
* params: InlayHint 

Response:

* result: InlayHint 
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the
 completion resolve request.
