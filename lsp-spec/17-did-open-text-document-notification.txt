DidOpenTextDocument Notification (
:arrow_right:
)

The document open notification is sent from the client to the server to signal
newly opened text documents. The document’s content is now managed by the
client and the server must not try to read the document’s content using the
document’s Uri. Open in this sense means it is managed by the client. It doesn’t
necessarily mean that its content is presented in an editor. An open notification
must not be sent more than once without a corresponding close notification send
before. This means open and close notification must be balanced and the max
open count for a particular textDocument is one. Note that a server’s ability to
fulfill requests is independent of whether a text document is open or closed.

The DidOpenTextDocumentParams contain the language id the document is
associated with. If the language id of a document changes, the client needs to
send a textDocument/didClose to the server followed by a
textDocument/didOpen with the new language id if the server handles the new
language id as well.
