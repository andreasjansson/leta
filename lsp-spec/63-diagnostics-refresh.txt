Diagnostics Refresh(
:arrow_right_hook:
)

The workspace/diagnostic/refresh request is sent from the server to the
client. Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh all needed document and
workspace diagnostics. This is useful if a server detects a project wide
configuration change which requires a re-calculation of all diagnostics.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): workspace.diagnostics 
* property type: DiagnosticWorkspaceClientCapabilities defined as
 follows:

/**
 * Workspace client capabilities specific to diagnostic pull requests.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface DiagnosticWorkspaceClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether the client implementation supports a refresh request sent from
	 * the server to the client.
	 *
	 * Note that this event is global and will force the client to refresh all
	 * pulled diagnostics currently shown. It should be used with absolute care
	 * and is useful for situation where a server for example detects a project
	 * wide change that requires such a calculation.
	 */
	refreshSupport?: boolean;
}

Request:

* method: workspace/diagnostic/refresh 
* params: none

Response:

* result: void
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the
 ‘workspace/diagnostic/refresh’ request

Implementation Considerations

Generally the language server specification doesn’t enforce any specific client
implementation since those usually depend on how the client UI behaves.
However since diagnostics can be provided on a document and workspace level
here are some tips:

* a client should pull actively for the document the users types in.
* if the server signals inter file dependencies a client should also pull for visible
 documents to ensure accurate diagnostics. However the pull should happen
 less frequently.
* if the server signals workspace pull support a client should also pull for
 workspace diagnostics. It is recommended for clients to implement partial
 result progress for the workspace pull to allow servers to keep the request
 open for a long time. If a server closes a workspace diagnostic pull request the
 client should re-trigger the request.
