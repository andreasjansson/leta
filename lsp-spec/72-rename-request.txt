Rename Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

The rename request is sent from the client to the server to ask the server to
compute a workspace change so that the client can perform a workspace-wide
rename of a symbol.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): textDocument.rename 
* property type: RenameClientCapabilities defined as follows:

export namespace PrepareSupportDefaultBehavior {
	/**
	 * The client's default behavior is to select the identifier
	 * according to the language's syntax rule.
	 */
	 export const Identifier: 1 = 1;
}

export type PrepareSupportDefaultBehavior = 1;
export interface RenameClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether rename supports dynamic registration.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Client supports testing for validity of rename operations
	 * before execution.
	 *
	 * @since version 3.12.0
	 */
	prepareSupport?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Client supports the default behavior result
	 * (`{ defaultBehavior: boolean }`).
	 *
	 * The value indicates the default behavior used by the
	 * client.
	 *
	 * @since version 3.16.0
	 */
	prepareSupportDefaultBehavior?: PrepareSupportDefaultBehavior;

	/**
	 * Whether the client honors the change annotations in
	 * text edits and resource operations returned via the
	 * rename request's workspace edit by for example presenting
	 * the workspace edit in the user interface and asking
	 * for confirmation.
	 *
	 * @since 3.16.0
	 */
	honorsChangeAnnotations?: boolean;
}

Server Capability:

* property name (optional): renameProvider 
* property type: boolean | RenameOptions where RenameOptions is defined
 as follows:

RenameOptions may only be specified if the client states that it supports
prepareSupport in its initial initialize request.

export interface RenameOptions extends WorkDoneProgressOptions {
	/**
	 * Renames should be checked and tested before being executed.
	 */
	prepareProvider?: boolean;
}

Registration Options: RenameRegistrationOptions defined as follows:

export interface RenameRegistrationOptions extends
	TextDocumentRegistrationOptions, RenameOptions {
}

Request:

* method: textDocument/rename 
* params: RenameParams defined as follows

interface RenameParams extends TextDocumentPositionParams,
	WorkDoneProgressParams {
	/**
	 * The new name of the symbol. If the given name is not valid the
	 * request must return a [ResponseError](#ResponseError) with an
	 * appropriate message set.
	 */
	newName: string;
}

Response:

* result: WorkspaceEdit | null describing the modification to the workspace.
 null should be treated the same was as WorkspaceEdit with no changes (no
 change was required).
* error: code and message set in case when rename could not be performed for
 any reason. Examples include: there is nothing at given position to rename
 (like a space), given symbol does not support renaming by the server or the
 code is invalid (e.g. does not compile).
