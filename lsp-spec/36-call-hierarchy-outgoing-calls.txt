Call Hierarchy Outgoing Calls (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.16.0

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve outgoing calls for a
given call hierarchy item. The request doesn’t define its own client and server
capabilities. It is only issued if a server registers for the
textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy request.

Request:

* method: callHierarchy/outgoingCalls 
* params: CallHierarchyOutgoingCallsParams defined as follows:

export interface CallHierarchyOutgoingCallsParams extends
	WorkDoneProgressParams, PartialResultParams {
	item: CallHierarchyItem;
}

Response:

* result: CallHierarchyOutgoingCall[] | null defined as follows:

export interface CallHierarchyOutgoingCall {

	/**
	 * The item that is called.
	 */
	to: CallHierarchyItem;

	/**
	 * The range at which this item is called. This is the range relative to
	 * the caller, e.g the item passed to `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls` request.
	 */
	fromRanges: Range[];
}

* partial result: CallHierarchyOutgoingCall[] 
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the
 ‘callHierarchy/outgoingCalls’ request
