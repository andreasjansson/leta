Folding Range Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.10.0

The folding range request is sent from the client to the server to return all
folding ranges found in a given text document.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): textDocument.foldingRange 
* property type: FoldingRangeClientCapabilities defined as follows:

export interface FoldingRangeClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether implementation supports dynamic registration for folding range
	 * providers. If this is set to `true` the client supports the new
	 * `FoldingRangeRegistrationOptions` return value for the corresponding
	 * server capability as well.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;

	/**
	 * The maximum number of folding ranges that the client prefers to receive
	 * per document. The value serves as a hint, servers are free to follow the
	 * limit.
	 */
	rangeLimit?: uinteger;

	/**
	 * If set, the client signals that it only supports folding complete lines.
	 * If set, client will ignore specified `startCharacter` and `endCharacter`
	 * properties in a FoldingRange.
	 */
	lineFoldingOnly?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Specific options for the folding range kind.
	 *
	 * @since 3.17.0
	 */
	foldingRangeKind? : {
		/**
		 * The folding range kind values the client supports. When this
		 * property exists the client also guarantees that it will
		 * handle values outside its set gracefully and falls back
		 * to a default value when unknown.
		 */

	};

	/**
	 * Specific options for the folding range.
	 * @since 3.17.0
	 */

		* folding ranges to display custom labels instead of the default text.

Server Capability:

* property name (optional): foldingRangeProvider 
* property type: boolean | FoldingRangeOptions |
 FoldingRangeRegistrationOptions where FoldingRangeOptions is
 defined as follows:

export interface FoldingRangeOptions extends WorkDoneProgressOptions {
}

Registration Options: FoldingRangeRegistrationOptions defined as follows:

export interface FoldingRangeRegistrationOptions extends
	TextDocumentRegistrationOptions, FoldingRangeOptions,

Request:

* method: textDocument/foldingRange

	PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * The text document.
	 */
