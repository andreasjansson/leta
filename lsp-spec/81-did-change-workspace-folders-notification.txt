DidChangeWorkspaceFolders Notification (
:arrow_right:
)

 Since version 3.6.0

The workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders notification is sent from the
client to the server to inform the server about workspace folder configuration
changes. A server can register for this notification by using either the server
capability workspace.workspaceFolders.changeNotifications or by using
the dynamic capability registration mechanism. To dynamically register for the
workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders send a
client/registerCapability request from the server to the client. The
registration parameter must have a registrations item of the following form,
where id is a unique id used to unregister the capability (the example uses a
UUID):

{
	id: "28c6150c-bd7b-11e7-abc4-cec278b6b50a",
	method: "workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders"
}

Notification:

* method: ‘workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders’
* params: DidChangeWorkspaceFoldersParams defined as follows:

export interface DidChangeWorkspaceFoldersParams {
	/**
	 * The actual workspace folder change event.
	 */
	event: WorkspaceFoldersChangeEvent;
}
/**
 * The workspace folder change event.
 */
export interface WorkspaceFoldersChangeEvent {
	/**
	 * The array of added workspace folders
	 */
	added: WorkspaceFolder[];

	/**
	 * The array of the removed workspace folders
	 */
	removed: WorkspaceFolder[];
}
