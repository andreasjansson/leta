DidChangeWatchedFiles Notification (
:arrow_right:
)

The watched files notification is sent from the client to the server when the
client detects changes to files and folders watched by the language client (note
although the name suggest that only file events are sent it is about file system
events which include folders as well). It is recommended that servers register
for these file system events using the registration mechanism. In former
implementations clients pushed file events without the server actively asking for
it.

Servers are allowed to run their own file system watching mechanism and not
rely on clients to provide file system events. However this is not recommended
due to the following reasons:

* to our experience getting file system watching on disk right is challenging,
 especially if it needs to be supported across multiple OSes.
* file system watching is not for free especially if the implementation uses some
 sort of polling and keeps a file system tree in memory to compare time stamps
 (as for example some node modules do)
* a client usually starts more than one server. If every server runs its own file
 system watching it can become a CPU or memory problem.
* in general there are more server than client implementations. So this problem
 is better solved on the client side.

Client Capability:

* property path (optional): workspace.didChangeWatchedFiles 
* property type: DidChangeWatchedFilesClientCapabilities defined as
 follows:

export interface DidChangeWatchedFilesClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Did change watched files notification supports dynamic registration.
	 * Please note that the current protocol doesn't support static
	 * configuration for file changes from the server side.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Whether the client has support for relative patterns
	 * or not.
	 *
	 * @since 3.17.0
	 */
	relativePatternSupport?: boolean;
}

Registration Options: DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions defined
as follows:

/**
 * Describe options to be used when registering for file system change events.
 */
export interface DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions {
	/**
	 * The watchers to register.
	 */
	watchers: FileSystemWatcher[];

/**
 * The glob pattern to watch relative to the base path. Glob patterns can have
 * the following syntax:
 * - `*` to match zero or more characters in a path segment
 * - `?` to match on one character in a path segment
 * - `**` to match any number of path segments, including none
 * - `{}` to group conditions (e.g. `**​/*.{ts,js}` matches all TypeScript
 *   and JavaScript files)
 * - `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment
 *   (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …)
 * - `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment
 *   (e.g., `example.[!0-9]` to match on `example.a`, `example.b`,
 *   but not `example.0`)
