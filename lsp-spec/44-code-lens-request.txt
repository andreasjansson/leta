Code Lens Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

The code lens request is sent from the client to the server to compute code
lenses for a given text document.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): textDocument.codeLens 
* property type: CodeLensClientCapabilities defined as follows:

export interface CodeLensClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether code lens supports dynamic registration.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;
}

Server Capability:

* property name (optional): codeLensProvider 
* property type: CodeLensOptions defined as follows:

export interface CodeLensOptions extends WorkDoneProgressOptions {
	/**
	 * Code lens has a resolve provider as well.
	 */
	resolveProvider?: boolean;
}

Registration Options: CodeLensRegistrationOptions defined as follows:

export interface CodeLensRegistrationOptions extends
	TextDocumentRegistrationOptions, CodeLensOptions {
}

Request:

* method: textDocument/codeLens 
* params: CodeLensParams defined as follows:

interface CodeLensParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams, PartialResultParams {
	/**
	 * The document to request code lens for.
	 */
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;
}

Response:

* result: CodeLens[] | null defined as follows:

/**
 * A code lens represents a command that should be shown along with
 * source text, like the number of references, a way to run tests, etc.
 *
 * A code lens is _unresolved_ when no command is associated to it. For
 * performance reasons the creation of a code lens and resolving should be done
 * in two stages.
 */
interface CodeLens {
	/**
	 * The range in which this code lens is valid. Should only span a single
	 * line.
	 */
	range: Range;

	/**
	 * The command this code lens represents.
	 */
	command?: Command;

	/**
	 * A data entry field that is preserved on a code lens item between
	 * a code lens and a code lens resolve request.
	 */
	data?: LSPAny;
}

* partial result: CodeLens[] 
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the code
 lens request.
