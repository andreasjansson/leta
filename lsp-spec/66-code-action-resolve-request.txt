Code Action Resolve Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.16.0

The request is sent from the client to the server to resolve additional information
for a given code action. This is usually used to compute the edit property of a
code action to avoid its unnecessary computation during the
textDocument/codeAction request.

Consider the client announcing the edit property as a property that can be
resolved lazily using the client capability

textDocument.codeAction.resolveSupport = { properties: ['edit'] };

then a code action

{
    "title": "Do Foo"
}

needs to be resolved using the codeAction/resolve request before it can be
applied.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): textDocument.codeAction.resolveSupport 
* property type: { properties: string[]; } 

Request:

* method: codeAction/resolve 
* params: CodeAction 

Response:

* result: CodeAction 
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the code
 action resolve request.
