Inlay Hint Refresh Request (
:arrow_right_hook:
)

 Since version 3.17.0

The workspace/inlayHint/refresh request is sent from the server to the
client. Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh the inlay hints currently shown
in editors. As a result the client should ask the server to recompute the inlay
hints for these editors. This is useful if a server detects a configuration change
which requires a re-calculation of all inlay hints. Note that the client still has the
freedom to delay the re-calculation of the inlay hints if for example an editor is
currently not visible.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): workspace.inlayHint 
* property type: InlayHintWorkspaceClientCapabilities defined as
 follows:

/**
 * Client workspace capabilities specific to inlay hints.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface InlayHintWorkspaceClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether the client implementation supports a refresh request sent from
	 * the server to the client.
	 *
	 * Note that this event is global and will force the client to refresh all
	 * inlay hints currently shown. It should be used with absolute care and
	 * is useful for situation where a server for example detects a project wide
	 * change that requires such a calculation.
