Hover Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

The hover request is sent from the client to the server to request hover
information at a given text document position.

When the client sends a hover request, the position typically refers to the
position immediately to the left of the character being hovered over. For
example, when a user hovers over a character c at offset n, the client typically
sends position n (the position before the character). However, how servers
interpret this position and what hover information they return is language and
implementation specific.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): textDocument.hover 
* property type: HoverClientCapabilities defined as follows:

export interface HoverClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether hover supports dynamic registration.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Client supports the follow content formats if the content
	 * property refers to a `literal of type MarkupContent`.
	 * The order describes the preferred format of the client.
	 */
	contentFormat?: MarkupKind[];
}

Server Capability:

* property name (optional): hoverProvider 
* property type: boolean | HoverOptions where HoverOptions is defined as
 follows:

export interface HoverOptions extends WorkDoneProgressOptions {
}

Registration Options: HoverRegistrationOptions defined as follows:

export interface HoverRegistrationOptions
	extends TextDocumentRegistrationOptions, HoverOptions {
}

Request:

* method: textDocument/hover 
* params: HoverParams defined as follows:

export interface HoverParams extends TextDocumentPositionParams,
	WorkDoneProgressParams {
}

Response:

* result: Hover | null defined as follows:

/**
 * The result of a hover request.
 */
export interface Hover {
	/**
	 * The hover's content
	 */
	contents: MarkedString | MarkedString[] | MarkupContent;

	/**
	 * An optional range is a range inside a text document
	 * that is used to visualize a hover, e.g. by changing the background color.
	 */
	range?: Range;
}

Where MarkedString is defined as follows:

/**
 * MarkedString can be used to render human readable text. It is either a
 * markdown string or a code-block that provides a language and a code snippet.
 * The language identifier is semantically equal to the optional language
 * identifier in fenced code blocks in GitHub issues.
 *
 * The pair of a language and a value is an equivalent to markdown:
 * ```${language}
 * ${value}
 * ```
 *
 * Note that markdown strings will be sanitized - that means html will be
 * escaped.
 *
 * @deprecated use MarkupContent instead.
 */
type MarkedString = string | { language: string; value: string };

* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the hover
 request.
