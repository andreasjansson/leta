Inlay Hint Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.17.0

The inlay hints request is sent from the client to the server to compute inlay
hints for a given [text document, range] tuple that may be rendered in the
editor in place with other text.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): textDocument.inlayHint 
* property type: InlayHintClientCapabilities defined as follows:

/**
 * Inlay hint client capabilities.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface InlayHintClientCapabilities {

	/**
	 * Whether inlay hints support dynamic registration.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;

	/**
	 * Indicates which properties a client can resolve lazily on an inlay
	 * hint.
	 */
	resolveSupport?: {

		/**
		 * The properties that a client can resolve lazily.
		 */
		properties: string[];
	};
}

Server Capability:

* property name (optional): inlayHintProvider 
* property type: InlayHintOptions defined as follows:

/**
 * Inlay hint options used during static registration.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface InlayHintOptions extends WorkDoneProgressOptions {
	/**
	 * The server provides support to resolve additional
	 * information for an inlay hint item.
	 */
	resolveProvider?: boolean;

Registration Options: InlayHintRegistrationOptions defined as follows:

/**
 * Inlay hint options used during static or dynamic registration.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface InlayHintRegistrationOptions extends InlayHintOptions,
	TextDocumentRegistrationOptions, StaticRegistrationOptions {
}

Request:

* method: textDocument/inlayHint 
* params: InlayHintParams defined as follows:

/**
 * A parameter literal used in inlay hint requests.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */
export interface InlayHintParams extends WorkDoneProgressParams {

	 * The text document.
	 */

	 * The visible document range for which inlay hints should be computed.
	 */

Response:

* result: InlayHint[] | null defined as follows:

/**
 * Inlay hint information.
 *
 * @since 3.17.0
 */

	 * The position of this hint.
	 *

	 * they appear in the response.

	 * Optional text edits that are performed when accepting this inlay hint.
	 *

	 * hint (or its nearest variant) is now part of the document and the inlay
	 * hint itself is now obsolete.
	 *
