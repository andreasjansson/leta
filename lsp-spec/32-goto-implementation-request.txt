Goto Implementation Request (
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.6.0

The go to implementation request is sent from the client to the server to resolve
the implementation location of a symbol at a given text document position.

The result type LocationLink[] got introduced with version 3.14.0 and depends
on the corresponding client capability
textDocument.implementation.linkSupport.

Client Capability:

* property name (optional): textDocument.implementation 
* property type: ImplementationClientCapabilities defined as follows:

export interface ImplementationClientCapabilities {
	/**
	 * Whether implementation supports dynamic registration. If this is set to
	 * `true` the client supports the new `ImplementationRegistrationOptions`
	 * return value for the corresponding server capability as well.
	 */
	dynamicRegistration?: boolean;

	/**
	 * The client supports additional metadata in the form of definition links.
	 *
	 * @since 3.14.0
	 */
	linkSupport?: boolean;
}

Server Capability:

* property name (optional): implementationProvider 
* property type: boolean | ImplementationOptions |
 ImplementationRegistrationOptions where ImplementationOptions is
 defined as follows:

export interface ImplementationOptions extends WorkDoneProgressOptions {
}

Registration Options: ImplementationRegistrationOptions defined as
follows:

export interface ImplementationRegistrationOptions extends
	TextDocumentRegistrationOptions, ImplementationOptions,
	StaticRegistrationOptions {
}

Request:

* method: textDocument/implementation 
* params: ImplementationParams defined as follows:

export interface ImplementationParams extends TextDocumentPositionParams,
	WorkDoneProgressParams, PartialResultParams {
}

Response:

* result: Location | Location[] | LocationLink[] | null 
* partial result: Location[] | LocationLink[]
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the
 definition request.
