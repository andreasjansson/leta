Linked Editing Range(
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook:
)

 Since version 3.16.0

The linked editing request is sent from the client to the server to return for a
given position in a document the range of the symbol at the position and all
ranges that have the same content. Optionally a word pattern can be returned to
describe valid contents. A rename to one of the ranges can be applied to all
other ranges if the new content is valid. If no result-specific word pattern is
provided, the word pattern from the client’s language configuration is used.
