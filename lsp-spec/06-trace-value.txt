TraceValue

A TraceValue represents the level of verbosity with which the server
systematically reports its execution trace using $/logTrace notifications. The
initial trace value is set by the client at initialization and can be modified later
using the $/setTrace notification.

export type TraceValue = 'off' | 'messages' | 'verbose';
