Configuration Request (
:arrow_right_hook:
)

 Since version 3.6.0

The workspace/configuration request is sent from the server to the client to
fetch configuration settings from the client. The request can fetch several
configuration settings in one roundtrip. The order of the returned configuration
settings correspond to the order of the passed ConfigurationItems (e.g. the
first item in the response is the result for the first configuration item in the
params).

A ConfigurationItem consists of the configuration section to ask for and an
additional scope URI. The configuration section asked for is defined by the
server and doesn’t necessarily need to correspond to the configuration store
used by the client. So a server might ask for a configuration
cpp.formatterOptions but the client stores the configuration in an XML store
layout differently. It is up to the client to do the necessary conversion. If a scope
URI is provided the client should return the setting scoped to the provided
resource. If the client for example uses EditorConfig to manage its settings the
configuration should be returned for the passed resource URI. If the client can’t
provide a configuration setting for a given scope then null needs to be present
in the returned array.

This pull model replaces the old push model were the client signaled
configuration change via an event. If the server still needs to react to
configuration changes (since the server caches the result of
workspace/configuration requests) the server should register for an empty
configuration change using the following registration pattern:

connection.client.register(DidChangeConfigurationNotification.type, undefined);

Client Capability:

* property path (optional): workspace.configuration 
* property type: boolean 

Request:

* method: ‘workspace/configuration’
* params: ConfigurationParams defined as follows

export interface ConfigurationParams {
	items: ConfigurationItem[];
}
export interface ConfigurationItem {
	/**
	 * The scope to get the configuration section for.
	 */
	scopeUri?: URI;

	/**
	 * The configuration section asked for.
	 */
	section?: string;
}

Response:

* result: LSPAny[]
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during the
 ‘workspace/configuration’ request
